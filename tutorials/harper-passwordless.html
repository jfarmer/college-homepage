<h3>What is SSH?</h3>
<p>
SSH is shorthand for Secure SHell, a program which is used for logging in securely to remote systems.  At <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">Chicago</a> this is the only way one can log into <a href="http://harper.uchicago.edu">harper.uchicago.edu</a>, the computer from which many people still read their email using pine and many more update their personal University websites (like this one).  The <a href="http://connectivity.uchicago.edu/">NSIT Connectivity Package</a> contains a copy of an SSH and SFTP client, the former being used to log in interactively to harper and the latter being used only to transfer files between harper and your personal computer.  With a little trickery it is possible to enable passwordless access to harper without reducing the security of the connection.

<h3>Generating SSH keys</h3>
<p>
When one uses vanilla <tt>ssh</tt> to connect to a remote server the authentication method involves typing in the password for that username on the server.  In the case of harper, this means you log in using your CNetID and normal directory password.  There is, however, another way of authentication: public key authentication.  Without getting into details, the basic idea is that public key authentication changes the means of authentication from verifying that you <i>know</i> something, i.e., your password, to verifying that you <i>have</i> something, i.e., your so-called <i>private key</i>. So, the first thing to do is generate a pair of public/private keys to use for logging into harper.  Open up your favorite terminal and run the following:
</p>

<pre class="code">
client $ <b>mkdir ~/.ssh</b>
client $ <b>chmod 700 ~/.ssh</b>
client $ <b>ssh-keygen -t rsa</b>
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/farmerje/.ssh/id_rsa): <b>&lt;hit enter&gt;</b>
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): <b>&lt;type password&gt;</b>
Enter same passphrase again: <b>&lt;type password&gt;</b>
Your identification has been saved in id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
44:22:a5:e8:82:78:13:b4:72:96:df:be:15:0b:53:ad farmerje@severian
client $
</pre>

<a name="unix-keyauth"></a>
<h3>Setting up key-based authentication</h3>
<p>
You have now actually created a pair of RSA keys to be used for authentication.  Make sure you actually type in something for the password, otherwise anyone who possesses your private key, located in ~/.ssh/id_rsa, will be able to connect to any account which uses this key for authentication.  The private key is always kept on the machine from which you are connecting, and the public key is placed on the server to which you are connecting.  Harper uses a version of SSH which is common on commercial operation systems, but which is incompatible with the version typically found on free UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems, called OpenSSH.  So, first, we must convert our newly-created public key into a format harper can understand.  Run the following:
</p>

<pre class="code">
client $ <b>ssh-keygen -e -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > tmpPubKey</b>
</pre>

<p>
Next, connect to harper and make sure you have a directory named .ssh2 in your home directory.  Back on the local machine run the following:
</p>
<pre class="code">
client $ <b>scp tmpPubKey cnetid@harper.uchicago.edu:.ssh2/id_rsa.pub</b>
</pre>

<p>
Finally, on harper, run the following:
</p>
<pre class="code">
harper $ <b>echo "Key id_rsa.pub" > ~/.ssh2/authorization</b>
</pre>

<p>
If you did everything correctly try to ssh into harper from the command line by typing
</p>
<pre class="code">
client $ <b>ssh -l cnetid harper.uchicago.edu</b>
</pre>

<p>
Rather than ask you for <tt>cnetid</tt>'s password, it should ask your for the password to verify your private key, viz., the password you typed the first time you ran <tt>ssh-keygen</tt>.  If you did everything correctly typing in this password now should log you into harper.
</p>

<h3>Passwordless authentication</h3>
<p>
You're probably thinking that you don't seem much better off than before.  Rather than typing in your directory password you're just typing in this new password you created only a few minutes ago.  Well, in terms of ease, you'd be right.  This is where <tt>ssh-agent</tt> comes in.  <tt>ssh-agent</tt> is a standard UNIX program to manage ssh keys.  Run the following (assuming you're using <tt>bash</tt>, <tt>zsh</tt>, or the like &mdash; if you're using <tt>csh</tt> or <tt>tsch</tt> run <tt>ssh-agent</tt> with the option <tt>-c</tt>):
</p>

<pre class="code">
client $ <b>eval `ssh-agent`</b>
</pre>

<p>
Finally, invoke <tt>ssh-add</tt> so <tt>ssh-agent</tt> knows what key(s) to use:
</p>
<pre class="code">
client $ <b>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa</b>
</pre>

<p>
You should be prompted for the password to <tt>id_rsa</tt>.  Now try <tt>ssh</tt>'ing to harper &mdash; you should be passwordless.  Adding <tt>eval `ssh-agent`</tt> and <tt>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa</tt> to something like <tt>~/.bash_profile</tt>, or the equivalent for your shell, will allow you to do this automatically each time you log in.  You could of course be clever since only one instance of <tt>ssh-agent</tt> ever needs to be running on a system.  There is a nice tool, written by the creator of Gentoo Linux, to take care of just this, called <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/keychain/index.xml">keychain</a>.  If you are using Mac OS X there are some nice graphical tools to all this command-line stuff.  You might try <a href="http://www.phil.uu.nl/~xges/ssh/">SSH Agent</a> or <a href="http://www.dreamflow.nl/projects/sshkeychain/">SSHKeychain</a>.
