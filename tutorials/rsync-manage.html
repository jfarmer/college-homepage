<h2>Managing your website with rsync</h2>
<p>
<tt>rsync</tt> is a utility and protocol that allows incremental backups of files between two computers, which means it transmits only the difference between files, saving bandwidth and time.  It was originally written by Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras of the Samba team, and you can <a href="http://www.samba.org/rsync/">download</a> it from the Samba website.  For those of you familiar with <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux</a>, they use <tt>rsync</tt> to distribute updates in their portage package repository.
</p>

<p>
Typically one runs <tt>rsync</tt> against an rsync server, put it is possible to use <tt>rsync</tt> to "push" updates <i>to</i> your web server.  In fact, one can do this over SSH, which means so long as you have SSH access to your web host (as Chicago students do with harper) it is possible to use <tt>rsync</tt>.
</p>

<p>
When I first started regularly maintaining this site I had it in my mind to make it as easy as possible.  To help facilitate this I wrote a little bash script which uploaded all files that had been edited since the last time I ran it.  It turned out, however, that <tt>rsync</tt> is able to do this all plus much more.  Here is the code I use to update this website:
</p>
<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

RED='\e[0;31m'
RED_BOLD='\e[1;31m'
GREEN='\e[0;32m'
GREEN_BOLD='\e[1;32m'
YELLOW='\e[0;33m'
YELLOW_BOLD='\e[1;33m'
BLUE='\e[0;34m'
BLUE_BOLD='\e[1;34m'
NORMAL='\e[0m'

function print_string ()
{
        echo -e " ${GREEN_BOLD}*${NORMAL} ${*}"
}

function print_ok ()
{
        echo -e "${ENDCOL}  [${GREEN_BOLD}ok${NORMAL}]"
}

function print_error ()
{
        echo -e "${ENDCOL}  [${RED_BOLD}!!${NORMAL}]"
}


COLS="`stty size | awk '{print $2}' 2> /dev/null`"
COLS=$((${COLS} - 7))
ENDCOL=$'\033[A\e['${COLS}'G'

USERNAME="farmerje"
HOST="harper.uchicago.edu"
LOCAL_DIR="${HOME}/public_html/home.uchicago.edu/"

print_string "Syncing $BLUE_BOLD${LOCAL_DIR}$NORMAL with remote host..."
if <b>rsync -rpLtz --delete -e ssh "${LOCAL_DIR}" ${USERNAME}@${HOST}:public_html/</b>;then
        print_ok
else
        print_error
fi

</pre>

<p>
For someone unfamiliar with shell programming this might look daunting, but it's almost entirely window dressing for the command I highlighted above: <code>rsync -rpLtz --delete -e ssh "${LOCAL_DIR}" ${USERNAME}@${HOST}:public_html/</code>
</p>

<p>
You can read the <tt>rsync</tt> <a href="http://manpage.org/cgi-bin/man/man2html?query=rsync">manpage</a> here to get an idea of what each of these options do.  Basically, it recursively copies the local version of my harper website and uploads it to harper, preserving things like file time and permissions.  The only funny option I use is <tt>-L</tt>, which tells <tt>rsync</tt> that rather than copying symlinks it should copy the file to which the symlink points.  Most people probably don't want this behavior, and to specify the opposite the option is <tt>-l</tt>.  I only use it because I have several files on my website which I do not want to keep in my local <tt>public_html</tt> directory, viz., my math files.
</p>

<p>
Of course, if you use this script you should change <tt>USERNAME</tt>, <tt>LOCAL_DIR</tt>, and <tt>HOST</tt> to whatever is appropriate for you.  What I find particularly useful is using this in conjunction with my <a href="harper-passwordless.html">passwordless logins to harper</a> tip, which makes updating painless.  In fact, using this trick, one could schedule a task or cronjob to silently update your website, or websites, every night.  You wouldn't even have to worry about uploading files yourself any longer!
